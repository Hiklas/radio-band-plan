## Overview

A simple App to display the UK (initially) band plan and frequency ranges and increments.  Essentially something that will work offline and give a helpful reminder of frequency ranges for anyone with amateur radio or scanners.

Mainly it's for me because I can't quite remember all of the frequencies I might be interested in as yet and I then have to spend a few minutes googling for the band plan and swiping through the PDFs.

Assuming I can get this iPhone/iPad app up and running then I'll add a watch app also :)  Don't hold your breath though, this could take a while :)
